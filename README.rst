Purpose
=======


`HectorGrapher` is a robust, continuous-time SLAM framework for mobile rescue robots, forked from `Cartographer`_.
The framework is developed for the needs of robust and efficient 3D SLAM for the mobile ground robots used for urban search and rescue research at 
`Team Hector <https://www.teamhector.de/>`_  and the 
`German Center for Rescue Robotics(DRZ) <https://rettungsrobotik.de/en/>`_.
